nethserver-createimg
====================

The aim of this package will be to supply a convenient way to create nethserver-arm images for the RaspberryPI. 

This tool will be based on the appliance-tools implementation of centos AltArch

Initial development of the KickStart files will be done in the ks_wip branch

On the day of initialization of this repository the appliance-tools package did not land in the centos armhfp repository. For convenience the SPEC files to build the tool and itâ€™s decencies are included.
